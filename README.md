## Description
This project is a clone of the popular Flappy Bird game, created using Python and the Pygame library. In this game, players control a bird that must navigate through a series of pipes by tapping the space bar to make the bird "flap" its wings. The objective is to avoid collisions with the pipes and the ground while trying to achieve the highest score possible.

## Features
- **Simple and Engaging Gameplay**: Players can easily pick up the game mechanics, making it accessible for all ages.
- **Dynamic Graphics**: The game includes colorful backgrounds, animated bird sprites, and moving pipes that enhance the visual experience.
- **Score Tracking**: Players receive points based on time ( that they are alive ), with a display showing the current score and high score.
- **Sound Effects**: The game features sound effects for flapping, and collisions, adding to the immersive experience.
